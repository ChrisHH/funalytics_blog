## Hi, I'm Christian! üëã

Based in the beautiful city of Hamburg, Germany, my life revolves around Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Far from being just a career, these domains are my passion, continually inspiring me to innovate and excel.

R, with its strong capabilities, is my chosen instrument for deciphering data's complexities, transforming raw numbers into insightful narratives.

My academic path began in the early 2000s, leading to a diploma in Medical Informatics & Biomedical Engineering. Advancing my educational journey, I obtained a Master's in Big Data and Business Analytics in 2021. Professionally, I have rigorously refined my expertise in market research, mastering every aspect from fundamental concepts to advanced techniques.

This blog is a window into the analyses I craft during my free time, sometimes venturing into my other interest, Avionics. ‚úàÔ∏è

To get started, you can check out my [blog](/posts.html).

PS: I launched this blog in 2021 and have now completely revamped it. The older blog posts will be gradually migrated to this updated platform.
