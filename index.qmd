## Hi, I'm Christian! üëã

Based in the beautiful city of Hamburg, Germany, I find myself deeply engaged in the fields of Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. These areas, more than just a professional path, are interests that constantly motivate me to learn and grow.

I often use R for its effectiveness in making sense of complex data, helping turn numbers into meaningful stories.

My educational background includes a diploma in Medical Informatics & Biomedical Engineering, obtained in the early 2000s. Furthering my studies, I completed a Master\'s in Big Data and Business Analytics in 2021. In my career, particularly in market research, I\'ve gained a broad understanding, from basic principles to more advanced methods.

This blog shares some of the analyses I do in my spare time, and occasionally, I explore topics in Avionics, another area of interest. ‚úàÔ∏èÔ∏è

To get started, you can check out my [blog](/posts.html).

PS: I launched this blog in 2021 and have now completely revamped it. The older blog posts will be gradually migrated to this updated platform.
