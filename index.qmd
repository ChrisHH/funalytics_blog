## Hi, I'm Christian! üëã

I'm based in the vibrant city of Hamburg, Germany, where I live and work immersed in the world of Data Analytics, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. My passion for these fields isn't just a profession; it's a pursuit that drives me to explore, innovate, and excel.

My tool of choice for unraveling the complexities of data is R, a powerful language that enables me to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

In the early 2000s, I embarked on my academic journey, culminating in a diploma in Medical Informatics & Biomedical Engineering. Fast forward to 2021, I further enriched my academic portfolio with a Master's degree in Big Data and Business Analytics. Throughout my professional voyage, I have meticulously honed my skills in market research, mastering the art from its foundational principles to its most intricate nuances.

On this blog, I showcase analyses that I craft in my leisure time. Occasionally, these delve into another area of my interest: Avionics. ‚úàÔ∏è

To get started, you can check out my [blog](/posts.html).

PS: I launched this blog in 2021 and have now completely revamped it. The older blog posts will be gradually migrated to this updated platform.
